## Zustand

[zustand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand) provides an easy way handling external state for `react`. But `merge` mode by default is not expected to us as we are familiar to `hooks`.

`strawberry-farm`overrides this behavior, now it's `replace` mode by default.

> `Form` component and `Versioned Storage` api are built upon `Zustand`.
